    h3 Monitor a stop
    p Monitor a single stop to see every bus or tram leaving this stop.

    p
        | You can also specify how many results to return by adding the number to the end of the route.
        | Interestingly enough the maximum amount of results you can get differs from time to time.
        | This is unfortunately not something I can do anything about, you're just going to have to live with it.
        | It is however quite functional and should only limit you in edge cases.

    h3 Find a route
    p
        | Query the server for possible routes from one stop to another.
        | Returns multiple possible trips, the bus-/tramlines to be taken, the single stops where the interchanges happen, the arrival and departure times for each of these stops and their coordinates (in Gauß-Krüger coordinates, for now at least).

        | You may call this route with different parameters depending on how specific you want to be.
        | Include just the time or call it with the entire date and time of when you're looking for the route.
        | If you don't include the date or time, it will default to the current time as in the example above.
        | Adding 'arr' to any of these URLs will tell the server to interpret the time as arrival time instead of default departure time and return according data.

    p
        | Be aware though that I cannot vouch for how exact either historic data or data quite a bit in the future turns out to be. Recommended usage is definitely current information ;)


    h3 Find a stop
    p
        | Search for a single stop in the network of the DVB.
        | Also returns the coordinates of this stop (also Gauß-Krüger for now).

    p
        | Note that all the other methods don't expect perfect stop names, meaning you don't have to look up stops before requesting a route for example.
        | As long as what you entered exists just once in the DVB database, it'll work.
        | "zelle" for example is already interpreted as "Zellescher Weg".

    p
        | The find method is a bit quirky at times as well.
        | It happily returns everything starting with "Alt", but "Zell" won't return anything.
        | Please work around this.

    h3 Additional information
    p
        | Use this API for whatever you like, but please don't stress it too much.
        | It's running on a single heroku dyno.
        | That also means that it's put to sleep automatically if not being called for a while.
        | Just be patient if this happens, Heroku wakes it up and it should work just fine.

    p
        | The code for this simple webapp is available on GitHub (see the footer).
        | So you can happily host your own copy if you like, on Heroku as well or not.
        | I'm also grateful for any reported issues and/or pull requests.

    p
        | This api and site is powered by a relatively small node module called
        =" "
        a(href='https://github.com/kiliankoe/dvbjs') dvbjs
        | .
        | Use it if you want to access DVB data from within your code directly.

    p
        | All of the data returned by this API of course belongs to the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe (DVB).
        | Please see their site
        =" "
        a(href='http://dvb.de') dvb.de
        =" "
        | for more information regarding their services.
        | I'm just offering a slightly easier way to access this information for those wanting to build awesome stuff :)
